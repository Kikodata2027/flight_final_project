* the flight dataset consist more than 1000000 observations with more than 10 colomns.
* the first step I did in the project is creating  a new colomn called delayreason depending on previous data...
* Firstly I removed the duplicated data from the main dataframe
* I conducted Independent analysis on delay reason and the distance and the delay reason
* i also plot the relationship between x and y distance and delay reason using library sns
* in the preprocessing stage I filled the missing values  by looking into delay reason
* after I filled the data I used standard scaller and label encoder and then I trained data and  found the accuracy for logistic regression and it was 88%
